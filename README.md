Hi there! 

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. This is a work in progress and a labor of love. It allows me to build technical skills and apply my creativity! 

I'm a highly analytical and detail-oriented data enthusiast. I recently earned a certification in Data Science Foundations from Codecademy and I am currently working toward a professional certification of Data Scientist: Analytics. I’m excited to bring my expertise and skills to the table, providing a solid foundation in key data science concepts and techniques.

I’m skilled in using Python and SQL for data manipulation and analysis, which helps me extract actionable insights from structured datasets. I’m also familiar with a variety of data science tools and environments like MATLAB, Jupyter, and Overleaf, which are essential for data processing and storage. One of my strengths is my analytical ability to solve data-related problems, identify patterns, and provide data-driven recommendations. I thrive in collaborative team settings, where I contribute to group projects and continuously learn from my peers to enhance my skills.

I’m committed to ongoing professional development in data science. I actively seek out new tools, techniques, and industry best practices to stay current in this ever-evolving field. I also pride myself in my ability to communicate data findings and technical information clearly, ensuring that both technical and non-technical audiences can understand and make informed decisions.

Here’s a snapshot of my technical skills:
•	Languages: SQL, JavaScript, Python, R, LaTeX
•	Software: MATLAB, Jupyter, Overleaf, Git
•	Design & Editing: Apple Productivity, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Office, Google Suite
•	Data Science Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels

I’m looking forward to connecting with fellow professionals and exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue growing in the data science field. Let’s connect and see how we can collaborate!
