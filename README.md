Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

You will find two types of projects in this portfolio, Guided Projects and Portfolio Projects. I am completing these projects as I pursue a professional certification of Data Science: Analytics. This portfolio illustrates my expertise in software programming, statistical analysis, data exploration, and data visualization.

Please feel free to explore and reach out to me if you have any questions. Happy coding!
